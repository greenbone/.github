## Best Security Practices
Borrowed from: https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/security_baseline.md
### Basic Operating Principles
To navigate these constraints, the following operating principles are adopted:

  * **Strong Bias Towards Automation and Automatability**
    * **Objective**: Enhance security by default and position security as an enabler rather than an inhibitor.
    * **Approach**: Prioritize automation and automatability to manage dependencies and vulnerabilities more effectively.[[Know, Prevent, Fix](https://security.googleblog.com/2021/02/know-prevent-fix-framework-for-shifting.html)], [[software supply chain transparency logical model](https://github.com/guacsec/guac?tab=readme-ov-file)]
  * **Minimal, Achievable, and Practical Security Baseline Requirements**
    * **Objective**: Design a security baseline that balances software reliability, performance, cost, and security.
    * **Approach**:
      * Ensure the Security Baseline is minimal and achievable with current technology.
      * Allow for incremental adoption throughout a software project’s lifecycle by shifting security left in the SDLC process.
      * Reuse existing OpenSSF guides and technologies with minimal new requirements.
  * **Documented Governance Process**
    * **Objective**:
      * Establish a consistent set of objective security measures for all participating foundations and projects.
      * Ensure the Security Baseline is an integral part of the TAC Technical Initiative life cycle process, and maintenance of the baseline follows the TAC decisioning process.
    * **Approach**:
      * Provide clear, implementable, and definitive guidelines for maintainers and contributors.
      * Incorporate the baseline into OpenSSF Technical Advisory Council (TAC) [technical initiative life cycle process](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/project-lifecycle.md).
      * Rely on every adopting project to submit issues to log the friction points and provide feedback to refine the Security Baseline, facilitating easier adoption.
      * Revision to the baseline will be a community effort following the [TAC Issue/PR process](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/TAC-Decision-Process.md#issuepull-request-types).

#### Security Baseline
As a software project progresses through the [OpenSSF technical initiative life cycle](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/project-lifecycle.md), it is beneficial to incrementally integrate more security measures.
  * Sandbox stage: Baseline awareness, and initial requirements
  * Incubation stage: Sandbox requirements plus additional baselines to sustain the secure project development and protect early adopters.
  * Graduated stage: Incubation baseline plus additional baselines to prepare for its general availability and sustainability.

This phased approach intends to support maintainers, contributors, and the community in innovating quickly with security built into the design or enabled by default.

##### Security Baseline - Once Sandbox
When the project starts, it's critical to have a security foundation to reduce a class of vulnerabilities and secure your digital assets with strong credential protections.

| Security Baseline | Objective | How to Implement | How to Verify|
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| A memory-safe language is adopted for new projects or new components. | Reduce  memory safety vulnerabilities at scale. | Choose one of the [memory-safe languages](https://www.memorysafety.org/docs/memory-safety/) <br /> <br />  For preexisting projects in C or C++, follow the [Compiler Options Hardening Guide](https://best.openssf.org/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++) | Check the [file extension](#Standard-File-Extensions-of-Common-Programming-Languages) and compare with the code. <br /> <br />
|Two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled for repository interactive access. | Reduce the risks of credential compromise and attacks on the digital assets.| 2FA is enabled by default at the enterprise level for all the organizations.<br /> <br /> Refer to [SCM Best Practices](https://best.openssf.org/SCM-BestPractices/) for more information. <br /> <br /> See [instructions for device setup](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication).|[2FA verification, drift detection and correction](#2FA-Verification-Drift-Detection-and-Correction) provides details for verifying 2FA is enabled, monitoring and restoring 2FA if it’s disabled. |

##### Security Baseline - To Become Incubating

As the project codebase grows and more features are added, increasing complexity, it becomes crucial to leverage security tools to identify vulnerabilities in the codebase or dependent software early on. Addressing critical issues early prevents costly fixes in the future. At this stage, projects MUST onboard to OpenSSF Scorecard by following the [installation instructions](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action#installation) of [Scorecard GitHub Action](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action). The Action runs on any repository change and raises alerts. ​​Repository administrators, organization owners, and people with write or maintain access to a repository can view the alerts in the repository’s Security tab. Ensure Scorecard is enabled for the project by following [Scorecard Verify Runs](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action?tab=readme-ov-file#verify-runs) instruction.

| Security Baseline | Objective | How to Implement | How to Verify|
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| There are no hard-coded active secrets in the project source repository. |Prevent unauthorized access to repository assets.| GitHub secret scanning and push protection is enabled in the enterprise account.

##### Security Baseline - Once Incubating
As a project matures and enters into the incubation stage, the project is expected to have more adopters. Additional security needs to be built into the project in order to sustain the secure project development and protect the consumers of the open source project.

Some requirements might be only applicable to some projects, for example, architecture design will apply to projects that have systems integration.

##### Cryptographically Protecting Data in Transit, in Use, and at Rest

###### Data in Transit

Cryptographically protecting data in transit ensures that data transmitted over networks or between systems is protected from unauthorized access, man-in-the-middle attack ([MitM](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/man_in_the_middle_attack)), [tampering](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/tampering) of data and systems, and data [breach](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/breach). These attacks lead to disruptions to critical infrastructure operations, for example, health care, utilities, banking and telecommunications. Businesses and individuals suffer from financial and reputation losses, regulatory compliance consequences and intellectual property loss. Recent ransomware attack on US hospital networks [endangered patients’ health](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/29/tech/ransomware-attacks-hospitals-patients-danger/index.html#:~:text=A%20ransomware%20attack%20on%20a,by%20the%20cyberattack%20told%20CNN.).<br /><br />Here are common use cases for encrypting data in transit to protect the  data confidentiality and integrity:
  * **Secure Web Communications (HTTPS)**: Web traffic is protected via HTTPS to  ensure that confidential information, such as login credentials, financial transactions, and personally identifiable information (PII), is protected from tampering and loss.
  * **Secure Messaging**: Applying cryptography to emails and instant messages ensures that the content of messages remains confidential and cannot be read or altered by unauthorized parties during transmission.
  * **File Transfers**: Applying cryptography to data during file transfers (e.g., using secure file transfer protocols like SFTP or FTPS) ensures that files exchanged between systems or individuals are protected from tampering and loss.
  * **Database Connections**: Applying cryptography to database connections (e.g., using TLS/SSL) ensures that data transmitted between applications and databases remains confidential and secure, preventing unauthorized access and data breaches.
  * **Remote Access**: Applying cryptography to remote access sessions (e.g., using VPNs or SSH) ensures that data transmitted across networks is protected from MitM.
  * **API Communications**: Applying cryptography to API communications ensures that data exchanged between different software applications or services over the network is protected from MitM, data loss and tamping.<br /><br />To protect data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity during transmission over networks or between systems, applying cryptography to data in transit is critical.<br /><br />When using cryptographic libraries, refer to section “Use basic good cryptographic practices” in [OpenSSF Best Practice Badge](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/criteria/0).<br /><br />HTTPS MUST be used for API communications. TLS 1.2 and above protocol SHALL be used.<br /><br />You can access GitHub repositories over HTTPS. If you have not installed GitHub CLI, you need to use a personal access token to run commands against GitHub. HTTPS access allows you to access GitHub API, or run Git commands using repositories HTTPS URL. <br /><br />You can use [SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-authentication-to-github) to authenticate to GitHub from the command line to work on your repositories. The setup is one time effort generating a SSH key pair, uploading a public key to GitHub, and pointing Git to the remote SSH URL. With SSH keys, you can connect to GitHub without supplying your username/password or personal access token every time when you log in to commit code, clone repo, etc. DSA SHALL NOT be used to generate SSH keys. The following algorithm SHALL be used:
  * RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman):
    * Minimum recommended key length: 2048 bits
    * Higher security: 3072 bits or 4096 bits
  * ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm):
    * Minimum recommended key length: 256 bits
    * Higher security: 384 bits to 521 bits
  * Ed25519:
    * Fixed key length: 256 bits

###### Data in Use
The most practical way to protect data during execution is with Confidential Computing techniques.
Confidential Computing protects data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based, attested
Trusted Execution Environment. Typically this entails memory encryption and sometimes integrity
features controlled by a restricted mode of a CPU, GPU, or other processor. Features are available
across different levels of granularity to isolate regions of a process, the entirety of a process,
and the entirety of a virtual machine. Isolating the smallest region limits exposure, see:
[Trusted Computing Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base)

Other means of protecting data during execution exist such as fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and
multi-party computation (MPC). These cryptographic techniques do not rely on hardware techniques
for their security, but they do have nuanced limitations and compute costs that restrict their
utility to certain case. For more on the comparison between Confidential Computing and FHE see:
[Confidential Computing and Homomorphic Encryption](https://confidentialcomputing.io/2023/03/29/confidential-computing-and-homomorphic-encryption/).

Open source software and guides are freely available through the
[Confidential Computing Consortium](https://confidentialcomputing.io/resources/white-papers-reports/).


###### Data at Rest
For data at rest, follow the instructions from the storage solutions for encryption practices

##### Curl and OpenSSL Tips
[curl](https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html) is a powerful CLI tool to troubleshoot and observe details of HTTPS traffic, including the TLS handshake and certificate information. For example the following command provides insights into a HTTPS GET request and response, including the x.509 certificate details, TLS protocol and cipher, etc. This [article](https://www.sectigo.com/resource-library/what-is-x509-certificate) provides a comprehensive overview of x.509 certificates.
```
curl -vI  https://google.com

-v: verbose mode, provides more details about the HTTPS response, including the SSL handshake and server side certificate information.

-I: Fetches the headers only (HEAD request), not the body of the response.
```
[openssl](https://www.openssl.org/) is another powerful CLI tool to [create CSR’s](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/openssl-req.html) and troubleshoot certificate related issues, especially issues along the certificate chain. For example, the following command provides details of the certificate chain for google.com, including the server certificate, the intermediate cert and the root CA that issues the intermediate cert.
```
openssl s_client -showcerts -servername google.com -connect google.com:443 </dev/null
```
